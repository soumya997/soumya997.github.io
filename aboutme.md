Hello I'm Soumyadip, I am presently working as a _Sr. Computer Vision Engineer_ at _Opencv University_, mostly contributing to their blog, courses and projects(hopefully).

Previously, I worked as a _Research Engineer_ at _Infosys CAI, IIIT Delhi_, focusing on Perception for the [Autonomous Vehicle project ALIVE](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive/home), under the guidance of [Dr. Saket Anand](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/index.html) and [Dr. Sanjit Kaul](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/). My main contributions were to the **ADAS** stack, **HD-Map** generation pipeline, **Traffic Light Following** (Planning), and the development of a **Virtual Testbed** for AV testing. Throughout my tenure at IIITD, I gained extensive experience in Python, C++, Carla, ROS, and PyTorch.

I graduated on 2022, with a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) degreeÂ in the field of Electrical EngineeringÂ fromÂ IEM, Kolkata. During my graduation I worked as a research intern at _IIT KGP_ under Dr. Debashish Chakravarty for landscape segmentation on **satelite data** and at _Uni. of New South Wales(UNSW)_ under Dr. Tanmoy Dam worked on **prior learning for GAN**, generative clustering. Iâ€™m also a **Kaggle Competition Expert**, I predominantly participated in Object Detection and Segmentation competitions.

> **Work Experiences**

- Im currently working as a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at Deep Vidya AI(OpenCV University).
- Former *Research Associate at IIIT Delhi* on the Autonomous Vehicle project *ALIVE(Autonomous Last mIle VEhicle)* underÂ _Dr. Saket Anand and Dr. Sanjit K. Kaul_. Checkout our work atÂ [Autonomous Last mIle VEhicle (ALIVE)](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive/home). Within the project, I contribute to the perception team, assuming key responsibilities in the development ofÂ **ADAS features**, **testing**, **HD map building**. For more about my work please check my resume below.


- During my *internship at IIT, KGP*, I worked on PolSAR satelite data for landscape segmentation. I also managed to publish a paper on unsupervised segmentation at [ICORT](https://www.drdo.gov.in/icort-21), 2021, IEEE. 

- I also have worked under [Dr. Tanmoy Dam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanmoy-dam-190ba534/), a Ph.D. student from UNSW, Sydney on *prior learning* for GAN, generative clustering, and generative classification.
