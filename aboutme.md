Hello I'm Soumyadip, I am presently working as a _Sr. Computer Vision Engineer_ at _OpenCV University_.

Previously, I worked as a _Research Engineer_ at _Infosys CAI, IIIT Delhi_, focusing on Perception for the [Autonomous Vehicle project ALIVE](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive/home), under the guidance of [Dr. Saket Anand](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/index.html) and [Dr. Sanjit Kaul](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/). My main contributions were to the **ADAS** stack, **HD-Map** generation pipeline, **Traffic Light Following** (DL & Planning), and the development of a **Virtual Testbed** for AV testing. 

I graduated on 2022, with a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) degreeÂ in the field of Electrical EngineeringÂ fromÂ IEM, Kolkata. During my graduation I worked as a research intern at _IIT KGP_ under Dr. Debashish Chakravarty for landscape segmentation on **satelite data** and at _Uni. of New South Wales(UNSW)_ under Dr. Tanmoy Dam worked on **prior learning for GAN**, generative clustering. Iâ€™m also a **Kaggle Competition Expert**, I predominantly participated in Object Detection and Segmentation competitions. 

**Skills:** Python, C++, Carla, ROS, PyTorch, Linux, Git and W&B

    <h4>Traffic Light Following</h4>
    <p>
      Implemented Traffic Light Following using C++ ROS package for Planning stack Behavior Tree. Trained YOLOP model for traffic light detections and 
      Ported the model to Nvidia Orin. Integrated the model with the traffic light following stack. Conducted comprehensive 
      testing of the P&C stack with Traffic Light Following in both the Carla and E2O platforms.

    <h4>ADAS: Forward Collision Warning (FCW)</h4>
    <p>
      Designed and developed ADAS system, Forward Collision Warning (FCW) with Integrated Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) maintaining the AIS standards. The project involved YOLOP object detection, tracking, and applying kinematic laws. The pipeline
was tested in Carla and later deployed in Nvidia Orin.

    <h4>ADAS & DSM: Traffic Light Warning on Carla with DSM </h4>
    <p>
      Designed and developed ADAS system, Traffic Light Warning (TLW). The project involved YOLOP object detection, tracking, GMM Classifier, and applying kinematic laws. The following video is a showcase of the TLW and DSM on Carla. Mediapipe Facial Landmark detection was used for Drowsiness prediction and driver attention prediction.
