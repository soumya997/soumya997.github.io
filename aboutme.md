Hello I'm Soumyadip, I am presently working as a _Sr. Computer Vision Engineer_ at _Opencv University_, mostly contributing to their blog, courses and projects(hopefully).

Previously, I worked as a _Research Engineer_ at _Infosys CAI, IIIT Delhi_, focusing on Perception for the [Autonomous Vehicle project ALIVE](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive/home), under the guidance of [Dr. Saket Anand](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/index.html) and [Dr. Sanjit Kaul](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/). My main contributions were to the **ADAS** stack, **HD-Map** generation pipeline, **Traffic Light Following** (DL & Planning), and the development of a **Virtual Testbed** for AV testing. 

I graduated on 2022, with a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) degreeÂ in the field of Electrical EngineeringÂ fromÂ IEM, Kolkata. During my graduation I worked as a research intern at _IIT KGP_ under Dr. Debashish Chakravarty for landscape segmentation on **satelite data** and at _Uni. of New South Wales(UNSW)_ under Dr. Tanmoy Dam worked on **prior learning for GAN**, generative clustering. Iâ€™m also a **Kaggle Competition Expert**, I predominantly participated in Object Detection and Segmentation competitions. 

**Skills:** Python, C++, Carla, ROS, PyTorch, Linux, Git and W&B

    <h2>Traffic Light Following</h2>
    <p>
      Implemented Traffic Light Following using C++ ROS package for Planning stack Behavior Tree. Trained YOLOP model for traffic light detections and 
      Ported the model to Nvidia Orin. Integrated the model with the traffic light following stack. Conducted comprehensive 
      testing of the P&C stack with Traffic Light Following in both the Carla and E2O platforms.

    <h2>ADAS: Forward Collision Warning (FCW)</h2>
    <p>
      Designed and developed ADAS system, Forward Collision Warning (FCW) with Integrated Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) maintaining the AIS standards. The project involved YOLOP object detection, tracking, and applying kinematic laws. The pipeline
was tested in Carla and later deployed in Nvidia Orin.

    <h2>ADAS & DSM: Traffic Light Warning on Carla with DSM </h2>
    <p>
      Designed and developed ADAS system, Traffic Light Warning (TLW). The project involved YOLOP object detection, tracking, GMM Classifier, and applying kinematic laws. The following video is a showcase of the TLW and DSM on Carla. Mediapipe Facial Landmark detection was used for Drowsiness prediction and driver attention prediction.

    <h2>Kaggle: HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body [TOP 6%, Bronze Medal]</h2>
    <p>
      Semantic segmentation of 5 imbalanced medical tissue types using only 351 high-resolution images from 2 different train-test sources. Trained Swin Transformer Tiny with Uppernet decoder, CoaT. Used SWA based ensembling for same model of different folds and then using TTA on
different models. Competition Solution [Github.](https://github.com/soumya997/HPA-HuBMAP-kaggle-solution)

> **Work Experiences**

- Im currently working as a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at Deep Vidya AI(OpenCV University).
- Former *Research Associate at IIIT Delhi* on the Autonomous Vehicle project *ALIVE(Autonomous Last mIle VEhicle)* underÂ _Dr. Saket Anand and Dr. Sanjit K. Kaul_. Checkout our work atÂ [Autonomous Last mIle VEhicle (ALIVE)](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive/home). Within the project, I contribute to the perception team, assuming key responsibilities in the development ofÂ **ADAS features**, **testing**, **HD map building**. For more about my work please check my resume below.


- During my *internship at IIT, KGP*, I worked on PolSAR satelite data for landscape segmentation. I also managed to publish a paper on unsupervised segmentation at [ICORT](https://www.drdo.gov.in/icort-21), 2021, IEEE. 

- I also have worked under [Dr. Tanmoy Dam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanmoy-dam-190ba534/), a Ph.D. student from UNSW, Sydney on *prior learning* for GAN, generative clustering, and generative classification.
