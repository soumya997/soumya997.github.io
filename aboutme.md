I have experience in Deep Learning, Computer Vision. I also actively participate in kaggle competitions. I have prior research and development experience in Autonomous Vehicle [ROS, CARLA, Opencv etc.], Satellite Imagery[PolSAR], GANs, Object Detection, Segmentation[Pytorch, MMdetection, timm] etc.

> **Work Experiences**

- Im currently working as a *Research Associate at IIIT Delhi* on project named ALIVE(Autonomous Last mIle VEhicle) under *Dr. Saket Anand and Dr. Sanjit K. Kaul*. As a part of the project we are building *Autonomus Vehicle for last mile connectivity*. Checkout our work at [Autonomous Last mIle VEhicle (ALIVE)](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive/home). I am a part of the perception team, mostly responsible for *ADAS features* of the car. For more about my work please check my resume below.


- During my *internship at IIT, KGP* I managed to publish a paper on unsupervised segmentation at [ICORT](https://www.drdo.gov.in/icort-21), 2021, IEEE. Also worked on landscape segmentation from satellite data.

- I also have worked under [Dr. Tanmoy Dam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanmoy-dam-190ba534/), a Ph.D. student from UNSW, Sydney on *prior learning* for GAN, generative clustering, and generative classification.
